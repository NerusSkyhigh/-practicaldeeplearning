# Exercises for fastai's course [Practical Deep Learning](https://course.fast.ai/)

As the title suggests, this repository contains my homework for the course [Practical Deep Learning](https://course.fast.ai/).

## Lecture 1 - Magic, Pokèmon, or Yugioh!

I aimed to distinguish between [Magic: The Gathering](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/anatomy-magic-card-2006-10-21), [Yugioh!](https://outof.cards/yu-gi-oh/guides/146-understanding-how-yu-gi-oh-cards-are-laid-out-card-anatomy-101/), and [Pokémon TCG](https://images2.fanpop.com/image/photos/9100000/Card-Anatomy-pokemon-trading-cards-9164776-725-740.jpg) cards. I got the idea for this notebook from an old project where I and a friend of mine tried to develop a physical classifier of Magic Cards.  
You can find the notebook here on GitHub or on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/nerusskyhigh/magic-pok-mon-or-yugioh).

## Lecture 2 - What's your drawing style?

As a lesson 2 homework, I trained an artistic style classifier based on the [best-artworks-of-all-time](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ikarus777/best-artworks-of-all-time) dataset. The main problem left is due to the non-uniform representation of artistic style for each artist. You can find the notebook on this repository or on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/nerusskyhigh/artisticdrawingstyle). A [basic webapp](https://huggingface.co/spaces/nerusskyhigh/drawingstyle) is available too on huggingface.

## Lecture 3 -
